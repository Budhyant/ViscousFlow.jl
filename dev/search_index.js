In such problems, there is an underlying system to solve, and the addition of constraints requires that the system is subjected to additional forces (constraint forces, or Lagrange multipliers) that enforce these constraints in the system. Examples of such constrained systems are the divergence-free velocity constraint in incompressible flow (for which pressure is the associated Lagrange multiplier field), the no-slip and/or no-flow-through condition in general fluid systems adjacent to impenetrable bodies, and joint constraints in rigid-body mechanics.","category":"page"},{"location":"manual/saddlesystems/#","page":"Saddle point systems","title":"Saddle point systems","text":"A general saddle-point system has the form","category":"page"},{"location":"manual/saddlesystems/#","page":"Saddle point systems","title":"Saddle point systems","text":"left beginarraycc A  B_1^T  B_2  0endarrayright left(beginarraycuf endarrayright) = left(beginarraycr_1r_2 endarrayright)","category":"page"},{"location":"manual/saddlesystems/#","page":"Saddle point systems","title":"Saddle point systems","text":"We are primarily interested in cases when the operator A is symmetric and positive definite, which is fairly typical.

These data are regularized to a field of primal edges on the grid, using the Roma DDF kernel.\n\njulia> x = [0.25,0.75,0.25]; y = [0.75,0.25,0.25];\n\njulia> X = VectorData(x,y);\n\njulia> q = Edges(Primal,(12,12));\n\njulia> dx = 0.1;\n\njulia> H = Regularize(x,y,dx;ddftype=Fields.Roma)\nRegularization/interpolation operator with non-filtered interpolation\n  DDF type ViscousFlow.Fields.Roma\n  3 points in grid with cell area 0.01\n\njulia> f = VectorData(X);\n\njulia> fill!(f.u,1.0);\n\njulia> H(q,f)\nEdges{Primal,12,12,Float64} data\nu (in grid orientation)\n11×12 Array{Float64,2}:\n 0.0  0.0  0.0       0.0     0.0      …  0.0       0.0     0.0      0.0  0.0\n 0.0  0.0  0.0       0.0     0.0         0.0       0.0     0.0      0.0  0.0\n 0.0  0.0  8.33333  33.3333  8.33333     0.0       0.0     0.0      0.0  0.0\n 0.0  0.0  8.33333  33.3333  8.33333     0.0       0.0     0.0      0.0  0.0\n 0.0  0.0  0.0       0.0     0.0         0.0       0.0     0.0      0.0  0.0\n 0.0  0.0  0.0       0.0     0.0      …  0.0       0.0     0.0      0.0  0.0\n 0.0  0.0  0.0       0.0     0.0         0.0       0.0     0.0      0.0  0.0\n 0.0  0.0  8.33333  33.3333  8.33333     8.33333  33.3333  8.33333  0.0  0.0\n 0.0  0.0  8.33333  33.3333  8.33333     8.33333  33.3333  8.33333  0.0  0.0\n 0.0  0.0  0.0       0.0     0.0         0.0       0.0     0.0      0.0  0.0\n 0.0  0.0  0.0       0.0     0.0      …  0.0       0.0     0.0      0.0  0.0\nv (in grid orientation)\n12×11 Array{Float64,2}:\n 0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0\n 0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0\n 0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0\n 0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0\n 0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0\n 0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0\n 0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0\n 0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0\n 0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0\n 0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0\n 0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0\n 0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"manual/fields/#ViscousFlow.Fields.ScalarData","page":"Fields","title":"ViscousFlow.Fields.ScalarData","text":"ScalarData <: PointData\n\nA wrapper for a one-dimensional array of scalar-valued data.
